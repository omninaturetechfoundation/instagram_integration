## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with Instagram integration on your website:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manish4586/instagram-integration.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in your code editor.

3. Replace the `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `YOUR_USER_ID` placeholders in `index.html` with your Instagram API access token and user ID. You can obtain these credentials by creating a developer account on the [Instagram Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/getting-started) platform.

4. Customize the CSS styles in `style.css` to match your website's design.

5. Save your changes.

## Usage

Once you've set up the project and customized the styles, you can integrate Instagram content into your website by including the following HTML snippet in your web page:

```html
<div class="instagram-feed">
   <!-- Instagram posts will be displayed here -->
</div>

<script src="https://www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>
<script src="js/instagram-feed.js"></script>
```

Make sure to adjust the CSS classes and file paths as needed to match your project structure.

## Customization

You can further customize the Instagram feed by modifying the `js/instagram-feed.js` file. This JavaScript file controls the behavior and appearance of the Instagram content on your website. You can:

- Change the number of posts displayed.
- Customize the layout and design.
- Add event listeners for interactions with the feed.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to meet your specific requirements.
